 ## Challenge 1 😃
 Create a class named `Animal` that has…
 1. a single stored property named `name`, that is a `String`
 2. a required initializer that takes `name` as a parameter
 3.  a function `speak()` that does nothing.

 Create a class named `Dog` that…
 1. inherits from `Animal`
 2. has a property that stores how many tricks it has learned
 3. implements the required initializer, defaulting the trick count to `0`, and calling `speak()` at the end
 4. overrides the function `speak()` to greet you and says its name

 Add a second (non-required) initializer to `Dog` that takes both the `name` and `numTricksLearned` as parameters. Then call this initializer from the required initializer.

/*:
 Add a convenience initializer to `Dog` that defaults the dog's name to your favorite dog's name, with however many tricks the dog has learned.
